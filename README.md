# Movie watchlist
## Practice with RESTful API's

This was a challenge in an online course I took covering API's. There were no tutorials or solutions offered to this challenge. The code is 100% written by myself and took a significant amount of searching for documentation. I am glad I challenged myself to complete this as I feel a lot more confident in working with API's.

I built this with an emphasis on functionality to practice calls to RESTful API's and handling the response from those calls.

The project uses local Storage to save the watchlist for the user. This took a little getting used to working with local storage but after some time it.
I am looking forward to creating my own unique project incorporating an API thanks to completing this.

I will add style to the UI soon.

API used:
- OMDb API - The Open Movie Database www.omdbapi.com
